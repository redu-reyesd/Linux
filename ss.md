## Overview

The `ss` command is used to display information about open sockets, network connections, and listening ports. It's a more powerful and faster alternative to `netstat`.

## Common Use Cases
- View all open connections.
- List listening ports and their services.

### Example Usage:
```bash
ss -tuln
```

## Practice Exercises
1. List all TCP connections on your system.
2. Identify which ports are currently open for listening.
