# Working with Network Interfaces Using ifconfig

## Overview

The `ifconfig` command is used to configure network interfaces on Linux systems. It allows administrators to view and change IP addresses, netmasks, broadcast addresses, and other network-related settings. Understanding how to manage network interfaces is essential for maintaining network connectivity and performance.

## Common Use Cases
- View all network interfaces and their IP configurations.
- Enable or disable network interfaces.
- Set static IP addresses.
- Troubleshoot network connectivity issues.

## Commands Overview

While `ifconfig` is commonly used, it is considered deprecated in favor of the `ip` command. However, many administrators still use `ifconfig`. Here are some common `ifconfig` commands for managing network interfaces:

| Command                  | Description                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ifconfig`               | Displays information about all active interfaces. |
| `ifconfig eth0`         | Displays the configuration for the `eth0` interface. |
| `ifconfig eth0 down`    | Disables the `eth0` interface.              |
| `ifconfig eth0 up`      | Enables the `eth0` interface.               |
| `ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0` | Sets a static IP address for the `eth0` interface. |
| `ifconfig eth0 broadcast 192.168.1.255` | Sets the broadcast address for the `eth0` interface. |

### Example Usage

1. **Viewing Network Configuration**:
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   This command displays a list of all active network interfaces along with their IP addresses and other configurations.

2. **Changing an Interface’s IP Address**:
   ```bash
   sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0
   ```
   This command assigns the IP address `192.168.1.10` with the specified netmask to the `eth0` interface.

3. **Enabling an Interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo ifconfig eth0 up
   ```
   This command enables the `eth0` network interface.

4. **Disabling an Interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo ifconfig eth0 down
   ```
   This command disables the `eth0` network interface.

### Output Details

When you run `ifconfig`, you receive output detailing the network interfaces. Here’s a sample output:

```plaintext
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.10  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
        ether 00:0c:29:9d:68:4b  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 123456  bytes 123456789 (123.4 MB)
        TX packets 123456  bytes 123456789 (123.4 MB)
```

In this output:
- **flags**: Indicates the current state of the interface.
- **inet**: Shows the assigned IP address.
- **netmask**: Displays the subnet mask.
- **broadcast**: Lists the broadcast address.
- **ether**: Shows the MAC address of the interface.
- **RX/TX packets**: Displays the number of received/transmitted packets.

## Practice Exercises
1. List all the available network interfaces on your system.
2. Change the IP address of a specific interface.
3. Enable and disable a network interface to observe the changes.
4. Set a static IP address and verify its assignment using `ifconfig`.
