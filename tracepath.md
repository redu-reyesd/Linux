## Overview

`tracepath` traces the network route packets take from your system to a destination, showing each hop along the way.

## Common Use Cases
- Troubleshoot network latency or packet loss.
- Trace the route to a remote server.

### Example Usage:
```bash
tracepath example.com
```

## Practice Exercises
1. Trace the path to a remote server and identify any points of delay.
2. Use `tracepath` to verify the connection route to a website.

## Relevance to Nagios
Nagios can automate `tracepath` checks to monitor network latency and identify any problematic network routes that may be causing delays.
