## Changing File Ownership

To change the ownership of a file or directory, use the `chown` command. This command allows you to change the owner and group of a file.

### Syntax

```bash
chown [new_owner]:[new_group] filename
```

### Example Usage

1. **Change the Owner of a File to a User Named `john`**:
   ```bash
   chown john filename
   ```

   This command changes the owner of `filename` to `john`.

2. **Change Both the Owner and the Group of a File**:
   ```bash
   chown john:staff filename
   ```

   This command sets the owner to `john` and the group to `staff` for `filename`.

3. **Change Ownership Recursively for All Files in a Directory**:
   ```bash
   chown -R john:staff directory_name
   ```

   This command changes the owner and group for all files and subdirectories within `directory_name` to `john` and `staff`, respectively.

## Output Details

When changing ownership, there is no output if the command executes successfully. You can verify the changes by using the `ls -l` command to view the updated ownership:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

The output will display information about the owner and group of the file, similar to the following:

```plaintext
-rw-r--r-- 1 john staff 4096 Nov 4 10:00 filename
```

- **`-rw-r--r--`**: The permission string.
- **`1`**: The number of links to the file.
- **`john`**: The new owner of the file.
- **`staff`**: The new group associated with the file.
- **`4096`**: The size of the file in bytes.
- **`Nov 4 10:00`**: The date and time of the last modification.
- **`filename`**: The name of the file.

## Practice Exercises

1. Change the ownership of a specific file to a different user.
2. Change the owner and group for all files within a specific directory.
3. Verify ownership changes using the `ls -l` command.
4. Use the `chown` command to set a fileâ€™s ownership to a user and group of your choice.
